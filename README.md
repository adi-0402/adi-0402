### About me:
Hello! I'm Adriana, a newcomer in IT. I developed a curiosity in this field and am officially transitioning into this career. I am currently participating in a Data Scientist bootcamp and studying programming and web development independently.

I am excited about the opportunities in IT as they allow me to learn about data analysis, machine learning, and web development. This helps me grow in this dynamic field and apply my knowledge creatively.ðŸ¥°
